## Chicken Pie

### Stuffing

Cook the chicken breast in the stock until tender.

Separate 1 cup of the cooking stock and set aside.

Sauté the other ingredients and add the peas last.

Shred the chicken, add it to the stock and cook until it is dry.

### Dough

Beat the milk, oil and eggs in a blender on low speed.

Gradually add the flour, salt and yeast.

Pour half the batter into a greased pan and add the filling on top.

Cover with the remaining dough and grated cheese.

Bake in a preheated oven (180° C) until golden brown.
