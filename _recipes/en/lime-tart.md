## Crust

For the crust, blend the butter cookies until they become small crumbles. Add the butter (melted) to the mix and blend.
You might need to adjust the butter amount to make sure the crumb is sticking together a bit, but did not become a dough
yet. Add a little bit of milk if the crust is not sticking together.

Put the crumbs in the bottom and the sides of the mold, and press it to make it compact. Leave it aside, and prepare the
filling.

Preheat the oven for 180C and bake the crust for 15 minutes. You can cover it up with tin foil and add some weight on
top to prevent the crust from cracking.

## Filling

Mix the sweetened condensed milk (Nestl√© is better, Dovgan also works), cream milk (Schlagsahne in Germany worked best for me) and lime juice. The amount of lime juice is up to your taste. I used around 5 limes for 2 cans of milk ingredients.
You can also put the filling directly into the refrigerator, and now you have Lime Mousse. You can beat it longer to make it more fluffy and airy.
