## Feijoada

Cook the raw black beans in a pressure cooker with water for about 20 minutes.

Cut the onions into small stripes, smash the garlic gloves and cut the chive into small rings.

Cut the sausages into 1cm disk slices.

In a big pan, add olive oil. 

For 1 to 2 minutes, golden the onions, garlic and white part of the chive rings. 

After that, add the meat and bacon and cook until brown.

Add the juice of 1 orange and the meat broth to the pan, and mix.

Add the green chive, bayleaf and cachaça and let it cook until it has reduced a bit.

Add the beans to the mixture, and slowly add the bean broth. 

Keep cooking until it reaches the desired consistency. Usually the broth is thick.

Then it's done! Serve with some [Arroz](../arroz-branco), [Farofa](../farofa) and [Couve](../couve) (or salad). Add some orange slices for better presentation.
Have some [Caipirinha](../../br/caipirinha) as well!

This portion can serve many people (Maybe 10), so if you intend to cook for a smaller audience, divide the recipe values proportionally.

## Variations

It's possible to make vegetarian feijoada. The pork meat is replaced with things like potato cubes, carrot rings, string beans and bell pepper.

## Where to find in Berlin

Some ingredients are available in Berlin, while others require replacement.

The black beans can be purchased at [Latino Point](https://latinopoint.de/de/), usually a 1kg bag.

The pork meat in the original Feijoada is usually a bunch of different pork parts, like ears, feet, etc. 

As a replacement, we're can use goulash style meat cubes, bacon and italian sausages (the non spicy one). 

All these ingredients and cachaça can be found at a big Kaufland.
