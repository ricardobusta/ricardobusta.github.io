## Farofa

Cut onion in small pieces and crush garlic.

Start with a spoon of Butter in a frying pan. Add onion and garlic. Golden for 1 to 2 minutes. Add manioc flour (Farinha de mandioca). Also, add the rest of the ingredients. The proportions can vary depending on the amount you want to do. Cook until it's yellowish. The butter/flour proportion must be enough so it do not get too dry, but you also do not want it to get dampen.

Then you are done! Goes very well with [Feijoada](../feijoada).
