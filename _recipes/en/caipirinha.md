## Traditional Caipirinha

Cut the `lime` along the axis. Remove the white stem to keep it less sour.

Squeeze the limes and add the juice in a cup. Add sugar (Usually sugar-cane sugar, mostly brown sugar) together with the
lime juice.

Add ice cubes and mix so the sugar gets mixed in and the coldness from the ice gets transferred into the liquid.

## Variants

It's possible to decorate it with lime slices.

It's also possible to do it with different fruits, like kiwis, strawberries, maracuja and pineapple. Technically it's
not caipirinha any longer, but it can be very good.

You can replace the cachaça with vodka to make the variant called `Caipiroska`. Or use Rum instead for a more
international approach.
