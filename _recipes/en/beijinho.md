## The paste

Add condensed milk, coconut and butter in the non sticking pan. Mix well with the spatula. Optionally you can also add cloves (to taste) at this stage, to add flavouring.

Turn on the heat until it boils, don't stop mixing, so it does not stick to the bottom of the pan.

When you mix it, and you start seeing the pan bottom, it means it's almost done. You can keep it for some minutes longer if you go for a more consistent approach.

The more it stays in the heat, more consistent and easier to roll up it will be. The less time it stays, it's better to serve directly on a spoon like a cream.

Take it out of the heat and let it cool. You can serve it room temperature, or you can put it in the fridge for lasting longer and serving cold.

If you added the cloves to the mix, remove them now before rolling.

## Assembling

In a small bowl, add the coconut rasps.

After cooling, roll the beijinho balls in the desired size, making small balls with the hands. A good size measure is the one that can fill in the sweets paper cups.

Beijinho can be rolled in the bowl with the coconut rasps to cover it while also keeping the round shape.

You can place the balls in the paper cups and serve. Pin each ball with a clove for traditional decoration.
