## Dough

Put the flour in a big bowl, and salt it.
Break an egg into it and while mixing, slowly pour in the water.
Knead it on the table covered with flour with your hands, the dough should become hard and uniform. Don’t hesitate to add flour so it doesn’t get too sticky.
You can’t use it right away, put it in a bowl and cover it with a lid, wait for an hour.

## Filling

Now is a good time to prepare the filling:
500g of minced meat (if you have access to mincing meat in arbitrary proportions from a butcher then 2:1 pork to beef is the best, but it’s also ok to buy a 1:1 mix from a supermarket (most common) in a 500g packaging form.
medium or large onion
salt, pepper
(optional) dried dill or similar herbs, nothing too exotic though, it’s a dish from Siberia after all.

Salt and pepper the mix of meats well (unsalted mince doesn’t taste good). Optionally add a bit of herbs.
Very finely chop an onion, no blender. Onion adds quite a bit of juiciness to the mix. Mix it in.

## Assemble

Now the tricky bit. Shape the dough into a sausage form (3-4cm in diameter) and cut it into small cylinders (of 2cm in height maybe). It’s not very precise, don’t cut it all in once, better experiment first. You’d need to flatten them into disks of 6-7cm in diameter with a rolling pin, not too thick, not too thin (too thin falls apart when boiling). Once you have a disk, put some meat in the middle with a teaspoon, fold it in half and carefully pinch it closed. As a finishing touch, you can also pinch two pointy ends together to make it more round (classic pelmeni shape).

If it turns out that there are too many pelmenis (I usually eat 15-20 pieces, for instance) – you can freeze them, no problem, just do it on a flat surface where individual dumplings don’t touch.

Boil some water in a big pot, salt it and optionally add some bay leaf. Once the water is boiling, drop the dumplings and very carefully mix them so that they don’t stick to the bottom. As soon as they float, wait for 1-2 minutes and they’re ready (for frozen ones wait for 7 minutes after floating).

That’s it, you can enjoy them with many seasonings but I personally prefer sour creme and black pepper. Some people like them with vinegar, some with just butter and pepper, some leave them floating in broth like a soup – possibilities are endless!

Enjoy! :slightly_smiling_face:
